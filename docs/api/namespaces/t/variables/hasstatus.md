# Variable t.hasStatus

Status is a derived property. It does not behave as a property because it is computed dynamically, but this helper can be used to determine whether the status belongs to each of the possible states.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
hasStatus: (status: TaskStatus) => QueryType.Bool
```
